Code to analyze multi-modal scRNA-Seq data from SARS-CoV-2 naive (n=4) and convalescent subjects (n=4) following mRNA vaccination. Data were generated by the 10x Genomics Chromium platform.

These scripts are related to the paper "Cytotoxic T Cells Targeting Spike Glycoprotein Are Associated with Hybrid Immunity to SARS-CoV-2" by Phan et al. (The Journal of Immunology, May 2023) [https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2200815](https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2200815)
